    "[Kyla Scanlon](https://kylascanlon.com/), an online content creator and independent economics educator, coined the term \"vibecession\" to describe a phenomenon where public sentiment about the economy is overwhelmingly negative, despite relatively positive economic indicators like GDP growth and low unemployment rates. The term is a portmanteau of \"vibes\" and \"recession,\" suggesting an economic downturn driven primarily by negative public sentiment rather than direct economic metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of the vibecession was introduced by Scanlon in a June 2022 newsletter, amidst observations that, while hard economic data was showing signs of stability and growth, the general sentiment among the public remained pessimistic. This disconnect, where the public feels economically insecure despite positive indicators, has been a central theme in Scanlon's discussions on platforms like TikTok, where she aims to make complex economic concepts more accessible and engaging to a broader audience, particularly younger people.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/) is an economic indicator that assesses the confidence, conditions, and expectations of U.S. consumers regarding their financial situation and the general state of the economy. The index is based on a monthly survey of approximately 500 households regarding their personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. It is divided into two parts: the Index of Consumer Expectations and the Current Economic Conditions Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is significant as it can provide insights into consumer behavior, which helps in predicting changes in spending and saving habits. Higher consumer confidence typically indicates that people feel secure in their personal financial situation and thus are more likely to increase spending, which is a key driver of economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index is often used by analysts and policymakers to understand consumer sentiment and its potential impact on the economy. For instance, rising sentiment can suggest increased consumer spending and economic expansion, while declining sentiment might indicate economic slowdowns or recessions."
