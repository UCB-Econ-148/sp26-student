    "\n",
    "According to this article at OMFIF:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinese renminbi should appreciate sharply against the US dollar over the next five years, reaching 5.5 per dollar by 2030, according to OMFIF’s latest forecasts. This represents a 20% appreciation from current levels and reflects China’s improving economic fundamentals, rising interest rates and the country’s growing influence in global trade and finance.\n",
    "The renminbi’s rise will be supported by China’s large current account surplus, which is expected to remain above 2% of GDP over the next five years. In addition, China’s interest rates are likely to remain higher than those in the US, attracting capital inflows and supporting the currency.\n",
    "The renminbi’s appreciation will also be driven by China’s increasing role in global trade and finance. As China continues to open up its economy and integrate with the global financial system, the renminbi is likely to become more widely used in international transactions.\n",
    "However, the renminbi’s appreciation will not be without challenges. The Chinese government may seek to manage the currency’s rise to support its export sector, and geopolitical tensions could also impact the currency’s performance.\n",
    "Overall, OMFIF expects the renminbi to appreciate significantly against the US dollar over the next five years, reflecting China’s improving economic fundamentals and growing influence in the global economy."

    "#### Understanding Raw vs. GDP-Adjusted Big Mac Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Mac Index provides two measures of currency valuation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raw Undervaluation** compares the actual Big Mac price in local currency (converted to USD or EUR at current exchange rates) directly to the price in the reference country. If a Big Mac costs $5.50 in the US but only $3.00 equivalent in China, the raw index shows the RMB is undervalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GDP-Adjusted Undervaluation** recognizes that poorer countries tend to have lower prices for non-tradeable goods and services (like labor, rent, and utilities) that go into making a Big Mac. The Balassa-Samuelson effect predicts that countries with lower GDP per capita should have systematically lower price levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDP adjustment accounts for this relationship by:\n",
    "- Comparing each country's actual exchange rate to what would be expected given its income level\n",
    "- Using a regression line fitted across all countries relating GDP per capita to Big Mac prices\n",
    "- Showing how much a currency deviates from what we'd expect for a country at that development level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** For China, the raw measure shows substantial undervaluation (often 40-50%), but the GDP-adjusted measure shows smaller undervaluation (typically 20-30%). This suggests that some of the \"cheap\" Big Mac price reflects China's middle-income status rather than pure currency misalignment. As China's economy develops and wages rise, we'd expect Big Mac prices to increase even without RMB appreciation."

    "### Understanding Brazilian Real Overvaluation: The 2010 and 2017 Peaks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big Mac Index reveals two significant episodes of **overvaluation** in the Brazilian real (BRL):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Peak 1: ~2010-2011\n",
    "During this period, the Brazilian real was actually **overvalued** (positive values in the charts), meaning it was trading stronger than PPP fundamentals would suggest. This occurred during Brazil's commodity boom era when:\n",
    "- High commodity prices (especially iron ore, soybeans, and oil) drove strong export revenues\n",
    "- Large capital inflows were attracted by high Brazilian interest rates\n",
    "- Brazil's economy was growing robustly, often exceeding 4-5% annually\n",
    "- Foreign investment poured into Brazil's pre-salt oil discoveries\n",
    "\n",
    "The overvaluation peaked at roughly **+20-30%** versus the USD in raw terms, though the GDP-adjusted measure showed a more moderate overvaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Peak 2: ~2017-2018\n",
    "A second, smaller overvaluation peak emerged around 2017-2018 when:\n",
    "- Brazil was recovering from its 2015-2016 recession\n",
    "- Interest rates remained high relative to developed markets\n",
    "- There was renewed optimism about economic reforms under the Temer administration\n",
    "- Global risk appetite temporarily boosted emerging market currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Pattern of Correction\n",
    "Both peaks were followed by significant corrections where the real depreciated back toward (and often beyond) its PPP-implied fair value. The shifts from overvaluation to undervaluation reflect:\n",
    "- Boom-bust cycles in commodity prices\n",
    "- Changes in global risk sentiment and capital flows\n",
    "- Domestic political and economic instability\n",
    "- The persistent challenge of Brazil's high structural inflation relative to its trading partners\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns illustrate that exchange rates can deviate substantially from PPP fundamentals for extended periods, driven by capital flows, interest rate differentials, and shifting economic narratives."
